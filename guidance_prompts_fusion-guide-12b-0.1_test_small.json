        "guidance": "---\n**Step 1:**\n\n- Define what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n- Explain the logic behind checking for primality. The simplest method is to check each number up to the square root of the given number to see if it divides evenly. If no divisors are found, the number is prime.\n\n- Introduce the function signature. The function should take one parameter, which is an array of numbers, and return a new array containing only the prime numbers from the input array.\n\n- Example function signature: `function filterPrimes(numbersArray)` where `numbersArray` is the input array of numbers.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n- Implement the helper function to check if a number is prime. This function should take a single number as an argument and return a boolean indicating whether the number is prime.\n\n- Example helper function: `function isPrime(num)` where `num` is the number to check.\n\n- Detail the logic of the `isPrime` function:\n  - If `num` is less than or equal to 1, return `false` because prime numbers are greater than 1.\n  - If `num` is 2, return `true` because 2 is the smallest prime number.\n  - If `num` is even and greater than 2, return `false` because it can be divided by 2.\n  - Use a loop to check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of `num`. Increment the loop variable by 2 each time to only check odd numbers, as even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.\n\n- Example implementation of `isPrime`:\n  ```javascript\n  function isPrime(num) {\n    if (num <= 1) return false;\n    if (num === 2) return true;\n    if (num % 2 === 0) return false;\n    const sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(num);\n    for (let i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) {\n      if (num % i === 0) return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**Step 3:**\n\n- Implement the main function to filter the prime numbers from the input array. Use the `isPrime` function to determine which numbers in the array are prime.\n\n- Example implementation of the main function:\n  ```javascript\n  function filterPrimes(numbersArray) {\n    return numbersArray.filter(num => isPrime(num));\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**Step 4:**\n\n- Provide a complete example of the function in use, including a sample input array and the expected output.\n\n- Example usage:\n  ```javascript\n  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n  console.log(filterPrimes(numbers)); // Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**Step 5:**\n\n- Discuss potential edge cases and how the function handles them. For example, what happens if the input array is empty or contains non-numeric values?\n\n- Explain that the function assumes all elements in the array are numbers and will return an empty array if the input is not as expected. For more robust handling, additional validation could be added to check the type of each element and ensure it is a number.\n\n- Suggest improvements or extensions to the function, such as adding error handling or supporting arrays of mixed data types.\n\n---"

        "guidance": "---\n**Step 1:**\n\n- Understand the structure of the SQL query. The goal is to retrieve the second highest salary from the 'employees' table. This involves using SQL functions such as `MAX()` and `LIMIT` or `TOP` to filter the data.\n\n- Identify the relevant column in the 'employees' table that contains salary information. This is typically named `salary`, but the exact name may vary depending on the database schema.\n\n- Recognize that the query should return only one result, which is the second highest salary. This requires handling ties in case multiple employees have the same second highest salary.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n- Use the `MAX()` function to find the highest salary in the 'employees' table. This will help in understanding the range of salaries and identifying the second highest.\n\n- The query should look like this:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary FROM employees;\n  ```\n  This query will return the maximum salary in the 'employees' table.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3:**\n\n- Subtract 1 from the highest salary to estimate the second highest salary. This is a common pattern in SQL to estimate the second highest value without directly querying the database.\n\n- The query should look like this:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT MAX(salary) - 1 AS second_highest_salary FROM employees;\n  ```\n  This query assumes that salaries are unique or that ties are not considered. If ties are possible, a more complex query is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4:**\n\n- If the database supports it, use a subquery to directly query the second highest salary. This method is more efficient and accurate, especially if there are ties in the second highest salary.\n\n- The query should look like this:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary\n  FROM employees\n  WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);\n  ```\n  This query uses a subquery to exclude the highest salary and return the second highest.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5:**\n\n- If the database supports window functions, use the `DENSE_RANK()` function to directly retrieve the second highest salary. This method is more efficient and handles ties correctly.\n\n- The query should look like this:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT salary AS second_highest_salary\n  FROM (\n    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank\n    FROM employees\n  ) as ranked_employees\n  WHERE rank = 2;\n  ```\n  This query uses a common table expression (CTE) to rank the salaries and retrieve the second highest.\n\n---"

        "prompt": "<guidance_prompt>How does the human immune system respond to a viral infection?</guidance_prompt>",
        "guidance": "---\n**Step 1:**\n\n- **Goal:** Understand the initial recognition of the virus by the immune system. This step involves the identification of the virus by immune cells and the initiation of the immune response.\n\n- **Key Points to Cover:** \n  - Explain how the immune system recognizes viral pathogens. This involves pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, which detect viral patterns or molecules.\n  - Describe the role of the innate immune response in this recognition process. The innate immune response is the first line of defense and provides an immediate, non-specific response to viral infections.\n  - Highlight the importance of cytokines in the immune response. Cytokines are signaling proteins that help to coordinate the immune response by activating and directing the movement of cells.\n\n- **Separate Section in Final Answer:** Yes\n\n- **Section Title (if applicable):** Initial Recognition of Viral Infection\n\n---\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n- **Goal:** Detail the activation of the adaptive immune response. This step focuses on how the immune system adapts to the specific virus and mounts a targeted response.\n\n- **Key Points to Cover:** \n  - Explain the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, in presenting viral antigens to T cells.\n  - Describe the activation of T cells, including helper T cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), and their roles in coordinating the immune response and directly killing infected cells, respectively.\n  - Discuss the activation of B cells and their differentiation into plasma cells that produce antibodies specific to the virus.\n  - Highlight the importance of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in presenting viral peptides to T cells, facilitating the recognition and activation of virus-specific T cells.\n\n- **Separate Section in Final Answer:** Yes\n\n- **Section Title (if applicable):** Activation of the Adaptive Immune Response\n\n---\n\n**Step 3:**\n\n- **Goal:** Explain the production of antibodies and their role in the immune response. This step focuses on the humoral immune response and its effect on viral infections.\n\n- **Key Points to Cover:** \n  - Describe how plasma cells produce antibodies that bind to viral particles, neutralizing them and preventing their entry into host cells.\n  - Explain the concept of antibody-mediated immunity and its role in protecting the body from future infections by the same virus, through the process of immunological memory.\n  - Discuss the different classes of antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD) and their specific functions in the immune response.\n\n- **Separate Section in Final Answer:** Yes\n\n- **Section Title (if applicable):** Antibody Production and Neutralization\n\n---\n\n**Step 4:**\n\n- **Goal:** Describe the role of cell-mediated immunity in the response to viral infections. This step focuses on the cellular arm of the immune response.\n\n- **Key Points to Cover:** \n  - Explain how cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) directly kill virus-infected cells to prevent the spread of the virus.\n  - Discuss the role of memory T cells in providing long-term immunity and a rapid response to subsequent infections.\n  - Highlight the importance of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and other cytokines in activating macrophages and enhancing the immune response.\n\n- **Separate Section in Final Answer:** Yes\n\n- **Section Title (if applicable):** Cell-Mediated Immunity\n\n---\n\n**Step 5:**\n\n- **Goal:** Summarize the resolution of the immune response and the establishment of immune memory. This step focuses on the aftermath of the viral infection and the body's preparation for future encounters.\n\n- **Key Points to Cover:** \n  - Describe how the immune response is regulated to prevent excessive damage to the body, involving the actions of regulatory T cells and other immune modulators.\n  - Explain the process of immune memory, where long-lived memory T cells and memory B cells are established to provide a rapid and effective response to future infections with the same virus.\n  - Discuss the role of antiviral immunity in protecting the body from reinfection and the importance of vaccines in mimicking viral infections to induce immune memory.\n\n- **Separate Section in Final Answer:** Yes\n\n- **Section Title (if applicable):** Resolution and Immune Memory\n\n---"
